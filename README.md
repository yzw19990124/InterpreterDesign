# InterpreterDesign

Description: The goal of this project is to understand and build an interpreter for a small stack-based bytecode language. The entire projects is implemented by OCaml. The functions would read the program to execute from the file specified by input, and write the contents of the final stack that the interpreter produces to the file specified by output.
Final Product: The customized interpreter would response to numbers of commands from the user input, such as addition, negation, reversion, etc., and translate these queries to machine code then output the result to users.
